Examplery videos of how the app works are in the [Videos](https://github.com/henrik2709/ARtifacts/tree/master/Videos) folder.
The AR aspect is not displayed in the videos, but the app uses a TFlite model to be able to scan for any of the pattern/motives via real time camera,
recognize the given motive and play the corresponding animation or redirect the user to the corresponding page.
